  "description": "A tool for simulating the detection and tracking of objects in a top-down 2D environment. Exports data into JSON format containing x/y coordinates and timestamps for testing and validating object detection and tracking algorithms.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Configurable Agents**: Speed and acceleration settings with waypoint linking for synchronized movement and timed waiting\n- **Vehicle Interactions**: Person agents can enter and exit vehicle type agents\n- **Dynamic Event System**: Automated events generated when entering/exiting vehicles, plus manual events with configurable conditions\n- **Sensors**: Configurable field of view and range, producing detection data only for agents within sensor coverage\n- **Background Images**: Configurable size and scale support\n- **Export Capabilities**: JSON files for each agent and sensor with coordinate and timestamp data\n- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, Linux, and macOS\n\n## Version 1.0.3\n\nSee the GitHub release page for detailed changes.\n\n## Download\n\nPre-compiled binaries for this version are available at: https://github.com/uread-cvg-detection-simulator/detection-simulator/releases/tag/v1.0.3\n\nThis Zenodo archive contains the source code for citation and archival purposes.",
